One day, Ralph the puppy moved to sleepy tree town.*
Everyone welcomed him and said, "Welcome to sleepy tree town, Ralph!"* 
All of the town animals yelled cheerfully.*
They were very nice and kind to Ralph.*
"I know I will love it here," said ralph happily.*
On monday. Ralph went to Kitty the Cat and borrowed her bicycle.* 
"I'll bring it back tomorrow." But He didn't.*
On Tuesday, Ralph borrowed crayons from Hoot the Owl.*
"I'll bring them back tomorrow." But He didn't.*
On wednesday, He borrowed slick the snake's guitar.*
"I'll bring it back tomorrow." But He didn't.*
On thursday, Ralph went to Tweety the Bird and borrowed her flute.*
"I'll bring it back tomorrow." But He didn't.*
On friday, All of the town animals met up and everyone was upset.*
"I want to ride my bike, but Ralph has it," said Kitty the Cat.*
"I need my crayons, but ralph has them," said Hoot the Owl.*
"I want to play with my guitar, but ralph has it."* 
"He has no respect for us," Slick the Snake said angrily.*
"We are angry!" shouted everybody.*
"Maybe we should borrow things from Ralph and not give them back," said Slick the Snake.*
"But that is not the right thing to do," said Kitty the Cat.*
They decided to talk to Ralph.*
"I'm sorry!" said ralph.*
"I was going to give them back one day."* 
"You said you only needed the things for one day," everyone said angrily.*
"We had no instruments for band practice yesterday," Tweety the Bird said with a frown.*
All of the town animals left Ralph behind and nobody wanted to talk to him.*
Ralph felt sad and said, "Maybe they want me to move away from here"*
Ralph sat outside his house and started crying.*
"I'm sorry!" Ralph apologized to everyone.*
"It's OK. We forgive you." said all of the town animals.*
"But you have to return the things on time when you borrow them," said Hoot the Owl politely.*
"I promise!" Ralph shouted happily.*
From that day on, Ralph always gave back the things he borrowed on time.*
Forgive your friends when they do something wrong.*
