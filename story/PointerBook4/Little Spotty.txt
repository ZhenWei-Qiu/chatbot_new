It was a nice warm day.*
The sun shined brightly.*
The shepherd lead his sheep to the field with nice green grass.*
The sheep were playing hide and seek.*
"One, two, three...ten! Ready or not, here I come!" Little Curly shouted.*
"Got you, Little Spotty! You are right behind Grandpa Sheep and Grandma Sheep."*
"A pretty sheep's wool should be all white," said everyone.*
Little Spotty felt upset.*
When big white sheep started counting, "One, two, three...,"*
Little Spotty quickly ran off.*
He ran far away till he could not hear big white sheep anymore.*
"I don't have pure white wool, but i will hide in a place where no one will be able to find me," said Little Spotty with a frown.*
Little Spotty walks to a pond.*
He saw a butterfly flying.*
The butterfly was so pretty and it has spots on it too.*
"Spotty butterfly, wait for me!"*
Little Spotty shouted and ran after it.*
"Wow, I just couldn't fine Little Spotty! He really is good at hiding this time," said Big White Sheep.*
"Let's all go find him!" said everyone.*
Little Spotty chase the butterfly and he ran into the woods.*
"Wow, I have not been caught! I will be the winner this time," said Little Spotty.*
Suddenly, there came the cry of a wolf.*
Little Spotty suddenly felt scared and his body started shaking with fear.*
"I am lost and I want to go home," Little Spotty cried loudly.*
The shepherd discovered that Little Spotty was missing.*
He took his dog with him and went looking for Little Spotty.*
At this time, the big hungry wolf open his mouth and showed his sharp teeth.*
Little spotty trembled and started crying loudly.*
The shepherd heard the cry of the sheep and said, "That's Little Spotty!"*
Little Spotty heard the sound of the shepherd, he then cried louder.*
The shepherd and his dog ran quickly to Little Spotty.*
They chased away the big bad wolf.*
The shepherd held up Little Spotty and put him on his shoulders.*
Little Spotty now understood no matter how he looked, the shepherd would always love him.*
Everybody was very happy to see Little Spotty back home safely.*
Every sheep is unique in its own way.*
