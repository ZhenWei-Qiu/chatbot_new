Leo and Ben were good friends.*
One day, Leo wanted to take a trip, and he asked Ben to go along with him.*
On the day that they were about to set off, Ben started to worry, "What should we do if other birds come and destroy our nests while we are away?"*
Leo thought for a few seconds.*
He then said, "If that happened, then we could rebuild our nest and make even greater and more MARVELOUS ones!"*
"You always look on the bright side," said Ben with a smile.*
On their way, Ben and Leo stopped to take a little rest.* 
Suddenly, the sky turned gray and it started to rain.*
Ben frowned and said, "Oh no! It seems like there is a storm coming! We'll never find a safe place to hide."*
Leo then thought for a few seconds.*
"Maybe there are some other owls' nests around here and we can ask them to give us shelter during the storm."*
"You always have such a positive attitude," said Ben.*
After a while, the rain stopped, but Ben sighed, "The storm has slowed us down."*
Leo looked up at the sky and he thought for a few seconds.* 
"But, look over there! We get the chance to see such a BEAUTIFUL rainbow!" said Leo cheerfully and excitedly.*
"Yeah, it's really beautiful!" said Ben.*
When Leo and Ben returned home from their trip, they saw their nests were the same and so were their friends.*
"Here we are back to our old life again. How boring!"*
"There is nothing new and special," sighed Ben.*
Leo thought for a few seconds and replied calmly, "Well. I think it's great hanging out with old friends who really know you."*
Ben hooted and said, "I really adore you for having such a positive attitude toward EVERYTHING!"* 
Always try to look on the bright side.*
