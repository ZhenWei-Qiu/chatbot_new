Once upon a time, there was a lazy little bear that lived in the woods.*
Little bear was too lazy to look for food and he knew nothing about cooking.*
Little Bear liked Little Bunny's homemade carrot cake.*
Little Bear also loved Little Squirrel's freshly-baked acorn pie.*
He surely wouldn't miss Little Goat's green grass salad.*
That was the way Little Bear passed his days, getting a bite here and a little something there.*
All the other animals wanted to teach Little Bear a lesson, so they played a trick on him by dressing him up like a chef.*
Later on in the evening, Little Bear woke up and he stretched his arms.*
He was thirsty so he walked back to the river for some water.*
"Ah- Who is this?" He screamed and was in shock.*
"Huh? Is this me?" Little Bear looked at himself.*
"Why am i dressed like a chef?"*
"Did god play a trick on me?"*
"Oh, I must be dreaming!"*
He pinched his cheeks really hard, "Ouch, it hurts!" He cried out.*
"It isn't a dream." He mumbled.* 
He stuck his one paw into the pocket and there was something inside.*
It was a book! He opened it and started reading.*
"Bananas, mushrooms, fish, honey...  Wow, this is a cookbook!"* 
"I really AM a chef!" he said happily and walked off singing.*
"Why are you dressed like a chef?" Little Sparrow stood on the tree branch and asked Little Bear.*
"Because i am a chef," Little Bear replied.*
"Really? Could you make me a loaf of wholegrain bread?" Little Sparrow asked.*
"Ok! Let me take a look...."*
"Oh dear! Does a chef always have to follow the cookbook?" Little Bear had no idea how to make the bread.*
"Maybe you can go to the Mushroom Village and ask the chefs there," Little Sparrow said.*
A little while later, Little Bear arrived at the Mushroom Village.*
He saw a brightly lit restaurant that was full of customers.*
A waiter saw Little Bear dressed like a chef and said, "Don't just stand there! Get into the kitchen now!"* 
There were many busy chefs in the kitchen.*
Little Bear followed the instructions from the chef and started to get busy too.*
"Are you the new chef?" One of the chefs asked Little Bear.*
"Actually, I'm not sure if I am a chef," said Little Bear doubtfully.*
"Anyone can be a chef, as long as they dedicated and willing to learn," said all the chefs.*
With that in mind, Little Bear started to learn how to cook at the restaurant.*
Everyone was surprised to see the changes in Little Bear.*
Anyone can achieve anything through hard work and dedication.*
