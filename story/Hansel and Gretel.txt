Hansel and Gretel lived with their father and stepmother in a little house near a wood.*
Their father was a woodcutter and he was very poor.*
They were all very hungry.*
One day, Hansel and Gretel's father said, "We have no money left. There is no more food for us to eat."*
"Then Hansel and Gretel cannot live here," said their stepmother.*
"We must leave them in the middle of the wood."*
"No," said their father.*
But their stepmother said, "We must."*
Hansel and Gretel were listening at the door.*
"I have a plan," said Hansel, and he went out to get some pebbles.*
The next day they all went into the wood.*
Hansel dropped pebbles on the path.*
"Wait here," said their father.*
"We are going to collect wood."*
Hansel and Gretel waited all day.*
Then they followed the pebbles back home.*
The woodcutter was glad to see Hansel and Gretel, but their stepmother was angry.*
"There is not enough food for us all," she said.*
We must take Hansel and Gretel deeper into the wood."*
"No!" said their father, "We can't do that."*
"We must," said their stepmother.*
"This time they must not find their way home."*
Hansel's stepmother locked the door so that Hansel couldn't get out.*
He couldn't collect pebbles.*
The next day they all went deep into the wood.*
This time, Hansel dropped breadcrumbs on the path.*
"Wait here," said their father.*
"We are going to collect wood."*
Hansel and Gretel waited all day.*
Then they looked for the breadcrumbs on the path.*
But the birds had eaten all the breadcrumbs.*
Hansel and Gretel went deeper into the wood.*
They walked for a long time.*
In the middle of the wood, they found a house made of sweets and cakes.*
In the house lived a witch.*
The witch planned to eat Hansel and Gretel.*
She locked Hansel in a cage and gave him lots of food.*
"Soon he will be fat enough to eat," said the witch.*
"Then I will cook him in my fire."*
"Where is the fire?" said Gretel.*
"Here," said the witch.*
And she opened the oven door.*
"I can't see the fire," said Gretel.*
The witch opened the oven door a litter wider.*
"I still can't see it," said Gretel.*
The witch opened the oven door as wide as she could.*
Gretel pushed her in and locked the door.*
Gretel let Hansel out of the cage.*
"Look at all this money," said Gretel.*
"We can take this home and buy food with it."*
After a long walk, Hansel and Gretel found their way home.*
Their father was very glad to see them.*
"Your stepmother has gone," he said.*
So Hansel and Gretel and their father all lived happily ever after in their little houses near the wood.*
