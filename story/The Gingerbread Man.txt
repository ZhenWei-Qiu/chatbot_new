Once upon a time, a little old woman made a gingerbread man.
She put him in the oven to cook.
Soon, the gingerbread man was cooked. 
The little old woman took him out of the oven.
The gingerbread man jumped up and ran out of the door.
"Stop, little gingerbread man!" shouted the little old woman. 
"I want to eat you for my tea."
But the gingerbread man would not stop.
The little old woman chased the gingerbread man, but she could not catch him.
Soon, the gingerbread man met a cow.
"Stop, little gingerbread man!" shouted the cow.
"I want to eat you for my tea."
But the gingerbread man would not stop.
The cow chased the gingerbread man, but she could not catch him.
Soon, the gingerbread man met a horse.
"Stop, little gingerbread man!" shouted the horse.
"I want to eat you for my tea."
But the gingerbread man would not stop.
The horse chased the gingerbread man, but he could not catch him.
Soon, the gingerbread man came to a river.
There he met a fox.
"I will help you to cross the river," said the fox.
"Jump up on to my tail."
So the gingerbread man jumped on to the fox's tail.
"My feet are wet," said the gingerbread man.
"Jump up on to my back," said the fox.
So the gingerbread man jumped on to the fox's back.
"My feet are still wet," said the gingerbread man.
"Jump up on to my head," said the fox.
So the gingerbread man jumped on to the fox's head.
Snap! Went the fox.
And that was the end of the gingerbread man.
