Lily saw a bird.
"We can help that bird," she said.

Rose saw a cat.
"Now we can help that cat," she said.
Lily and Rose helped the cat.
Lily saw a mouse.
"Now we can help that mouse," she said.
It was not a mouse!
It was Patch, a bad elf.
Patch liked to play tricks.
He had turned into a mouse to trick Lily and Rose.
Rose saw a dog.
"We can help that dog," she said.
Lily and Rose went to help the dog.
It was not a dog.
It was Patch the elf!
He had turned into a dog to trick Lily and Rose.
"Go away, Patch!" said Lily and Rose.
"You are a bad elf!"
Lily saw a fairy.
"We can help that fairy," she said.
"That is not a fairy," said Rose.
"It is Patch. Go away, Patch, you bad elf!"
They saw the fairy, and they saw Patch, too!
"It IS a fairy," said Rose.
"We can help you," said Lily.
Lily and Rose helped the fairy.
Patch turned into a bird and he helped, too.
The fairy was Lily and Rose's new friend.
Now Patch was their friend, too.
