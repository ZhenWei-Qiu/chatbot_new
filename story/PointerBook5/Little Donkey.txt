On a farm, there was a farmer who had raised lots of animals.*
There were a tall, handsome horse, three Donkeys, and five strong oxen.*
One morning, the farmer came to the farm.*
"Good morning, my dear master," Little Donkey greeted the farmer.*
"Good morning, Little Donkey," the farmer replied as he led the horse out of the barn.*
Little Donkey saw the farmer ride away on the horse.*
The horse looks so handsome.*
"I wish I could give the master a ride too," Little Donkey thought with admiration.*
"Good morning Little Donkey," said the farmhand, Uncle Tim.*
"Good morning, Uncle Tim.  Are you going to work in the field today?" Little Donkey asked.*
"Of course," yawned Uncle Tim as he untied the oxen and led them out to the field.*
"When will I be as strong as the oxen?" Little Donkey wondered as he watched Uncle Tim led the oxen away.*
"Good morning, madam." Little Donkey greeted the farmer's wife when he saw her walk to the farm.*
"Good morning, little Donkey." the farmer's wife said.*
"Will you be going to the market today?" Little Donkey asked.*
"Of course, Little Donkey." said the farmer's wife as she put some heavy loads onto the back of Little Donkey's father.*
"Let me help." said the Little Donkey.*
"No dear, these loads will be too heavy for you," the farmer's wife said as she led Little Donkey off to the side.*
Not long after that, Aunty Nancy arrived at the farm.*
"Take me to turn the millstone today. I'm ready!" said Little Donkey when he saw Aunty Nancy.*
"No dear Little Donkey, you are still too small," said Aunty Nancy as she led Little Donkey's mother off to the mill.*
Everyone on the farm had a job to do except Little Donkey.*
He was left alone in his stall every day.*
There was nothing for him to do and he felt sad.*
"Is there anything I can do?" he murmured sadly.*
"What use is a little Donkey like me?"*
Then one day, a visitor came from the king to the farm.*
"The king wants this little donkey," he said to the farmer.*
"On this farm, we have a handsomest, fastest horse that we can offer to the great king," said the farmer, pointing toward the horse stall.*
But the visitor just looked carefully at little Donkey and said, "No, this is the one. The king wants this little Donkey that has never been ridden before."*
As the little donkey was leaving the farm with the visitor, he started wondering, "How could a king that is so great and noble possibly want me?"*
The king smiled when he saw a Little Donkey.*
"This little donkey seems like he is full of energy!" said the king while patting Little Donkey gently.*
Little Donkey looked at the great king, who seemed so gentle and noble but acted so humble.*
Little Donkey liked him right away.*
So the king gave up his majestic horse, and with all his servants following him, he rode on Little Donkey to town instead.*
On the way, all the people came out to cheer, greet and honor the noble king who was riding on the little donkey.*
As the King rode Little Donkey through the cheering crowd, it really was the happiest and most honorable day in Little Donkey's life.*
Who would have ever thought that a little donkey would have the great honor and privilege to serve the great king?*
Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young.*
All things in their being are good for something.*
