Little Hedgehog's birthday is coming up soon.* 
All his good friends are all busy preparing presents for him.*
They want to give him a big surprise.*
Little Raccoon is going to give a drum to Little Hedgehog because Little Hedgehog is very good at playing the drum*. 
Little Kitten is going to give a book to Little Hedgehog because she knows that Little Hedgehog loves reading.*
Little Duckling is going to give a new set of crayons to Little Hedgehog because he knows Little Hedgehog is running out of crayons soon.*
Little Monkey is Little Hedgehog's best friend.*
He is trying very hard to think what to give to Little Hedgehog.*
Little Monkey is usually very smart, but this time he is really out of ideas.*
He keeps on thanking and thinking....*
"There must be something that can make Little Hedgehog happy and also show my good taste," Little Monkey thinks.*
"But what should that be?"*
All of a sudden, an idea comes into Little Monkey's head.*
He decides to give Little Hedgehog his new T-shirt that he just bought.*
He's willing to give it to Little Hedgehog because they are best friends.*
On the day of Little Hedgehog's birthday, all his good friends gather in his house.*
By the time Little Hedgehog starts opening the presents, he is really happy to receive so many surprises from his friends.*
Little Hedgehog picks up the drum and he plays a beautiful and happy melody.*
They all sing and dance happily together.*
Then Little Hedgehog's mommy takes out the new storybook from Little Kitten.*
She reads a very exciting and interesting story to everyone.*
After eating the cake, everyone uses the new crayons from Little Duckling.*
They all draw mini pretty pictures.*
Everyone is so happy and everything is going very well.*
Little Monkey asks Little Hedgehog, "Hey Little Hedgehog, don't you like my present?"*
Little Hedgehog says with a big smile, "I really love it! But because I love it so much..."*
"I just don't want to poke holes in it."*
"Oh dear me! Now i get it."*
Little Monkey realizes why Little Hedgehog does not put on the new t-shirt he gave him.*
He suddenly feel so embarrassed.*
"I didn't put myself in your shoes when I prepared for your gift."*
The smart Little Monkey feels so embarrassed and also a bit depressed.*
Little Hedgehogs mommy says with a warm smile, "It's OK," we all know your kindness is as beautiful as this pretty T-shirt.*
"That's right!" everyone agrees and says to Little Monkey.*
Now Little Monkey has a big smile on his face once again.*
It's not the gift, but the thought that counts.*
