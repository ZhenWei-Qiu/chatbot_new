The aim and final end of all music. Should be none other than the glory of God and the refreshment of the soul."-Johann Sebastian Bach.*
However, there is one little girl who totally doesn't agree.*
That girl's name is Claudia, she just hates playing the piano.*
She wishes there were no such thing as a "PIANO".*
She even wishes that the thing called "MUSIC" would disappear too.*
One day when she woke up, her piano really disappeared.*
All the notes in her music books and all the things related to music were all gone!*
"Wow! Cool!" Claudia shouts excitedly.*
Claudia turned on the tv; all the cartoons had become so boring.*
She then turned on the radio; there was no music at all.*
All she could hear was a terrible noise.*
Claudia picked up the phone and called her piano teacher.*
She asked her teacher something about music, but her teacher said that she had never heard of anyone called Bach, Beethoven, Handel or Mozart.*
The next day, Claudia was on her way to school.*
The two little canaries that were owned by Grandpa Noah, had suddenly become so quiet and were not singing like they used to.*
The roads were filled with cars, taxis and buses.*
There were people crowded on the streets, however you couldn't see anyone with a smiling face.*
In the school, it was already passed the school hour, but the school bell hadn't rung.*
The garbage truck used to play the song "Maiden's Prayer," but now, it had become the loud and grumpy voice screaming out of a big microphone.*
All of a sudden, the people and the vehicles on the streets have started to disappear one by one.*
There were black shadows that would catch people everywhere.*
They swallowed up everything they could see and get.*
Claudia's body shuttered and her eyes opened, then she realized it was all just a dream.*
She quickly got out of her bed and discovered her piano was still in her room.*
Claudia finally realized that music played such an important role in her life.*
Appreciate what you have before it turns into what you had.*
