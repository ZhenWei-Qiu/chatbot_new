Late in the afternoon, Mandy and her mom were on their way home and they passed a little playground in a park.*
"Mommy, I want to play on the swing, but...she's there again," said Mandy timidly.*
Mandy's mom held her hand while they walked toward the swings.*
"Mom...," said Mandy in a louder voice and held her mom's arm tighter.*
"Don't worry, my dear, there is no need to be afraid. Sophie is a very nice and kind girl," Mandy's mom said, encouraging her to play with Sophie on the swings.*
Mandy walked slowly toward the swings.*
At first, Sophie didn't seem to notice Mandy was close by.*
Mandy sat on the other swing next to Sophie's and the two swings started swinging back and forth.*
Just then, Sophie started laughing cheerfully with Mandy.*
At bed time, when Mandy's mom was tucking her in bed, Mandy said with curiosity, "Mom, Sophie seems to be quite different from us."*
"Yes dear. That's because Sophie is very special. She has Down Syndrome," her mom explained.* 
Mandy was puzzled and asked, "What is Down Syndrome and why did she get it?"*
"Nobody knows why. It just happens by chance and that's why I said Sophia is special!"*
"My dear Mandy, it's very nice of you that you are willing to play with Sophie."*
The next day, Mandy and Sophie met at the playground again.*
"Hey, Sophie, it's good to see you again!  Let's go and play on the slide today!" said Mandy,  taking Sophie's hand and getting ready to run.*
"No. Let's just play on the swings!" said Sophie.*
"But we played on the swings yesterday. It's boring to play on the same thing every day!" said Mandy.*
"No, it's not boring. I like to play on the swings!" said Sophie timidly.*
"I don't want to play with you!" yelled Mandy, then she ran away and left Sophie by herself at the playground.*
Sophie was a bit shocked and confused about why Mandy was so upset with her.*
She felt a little sad, but she still went to play on the swings.*
Mandy got home and kept murmuring.*
She was still feeling upset about Sophie.*
"Are you mad at Sophie?" her mom asked.*
"She only wants to play on the swings! he never wants to try anything else, even when I asked her to," said Mandy grumpily.*
"As I have told you, Sophie is a very special girl. Once her mind is set on something, it's hard for her to change, but that doesn't mean she is bad or unkind."*
"Maybe you can try and help her to learn and play other games next time!"*
Mandy and her mom were on the way to visit her grandma.*
As they walked past a bakery shop, the beautiful display caught Mandy's eye.*
When they got into the bakery shop, they saw various kinds of bread and pastries.*
Mandy pointed to one of them and said.*
"Mom, this bread is very special! Just like my special friend, Sophie!"*
Mom smile and replied, "Yes my dear!"*
The next day, Mandy went to the playground and Sophie was sitting on the swing.*
"Hi, Mandy!" said Sophie happily when she saw Mandy walking towards her.*
Mandy brought out a little box and gave it to Sophie, then said with a big smile, "This is a special cake for you. It's just as special as our friendship!"*
Sophie opened the box and saw there was a beautiful cake in the box.*
She smiled and said happily, "Thank you, Mandy. You're my special friend too!"*
Everyone should be treated equally.*
Try to love one another and be kind to each other.*
