One day, Dom saw a little red egg.
It was a little bit hot and it glowed.
Dom hid the little red egg under his bed.
The next day, the egg hatched.
A little red dragon hatched out.
She was a little bit hot.
And she glowed.
"I will call you Glow," said Dom.
"You must hide under the bed," said Dom.
"or I will have to tell the king about you." said Dom.
That night, Dom¡¦s bed was nice and warm.
But Glow was growing bigger and bigger.
"You must hide in the bathroom," said Dom.
"or I will have to tell the king about you." said Dom.
The next day, there was very hot water in the bathroom.
The towels were nice and warm, too.
But Glow was growing bigger and bigger.
"You must hide in the kitchen," said Dom.
"or I will have to tell the king about you." said Dom.
The next day there was nice hot food in the kitchen, on nice warm plates.
"Glow, you are getting too big and too hot," said Dom.
"We will have to tell Mum." said Dom.
"You have a dragon?" said Mum.
"We will have to tell the king about her." said Mum.
"You have a dragon?" said the king.
"What will we do with her?" said the king.
"She has made everything nice and warm." said Dom.
The king made a big house for Glow in the town.
The house had very big pipes.
Dom took Glow to the house.
Glow made everything hot.
The pipes took hot water to every house in the town.
Everyone had nice warm towels, too.
Glow made hot food for everyone in the town, on nice warm plates.
Glow was happy.
Dom was happy, too.
But one day, Dom saw three little red eggs.
