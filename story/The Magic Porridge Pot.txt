Once upon a time, a little girl met an old woman.
The old woman gave her a magic porridge pot.
"Cook, little pot, cook," said the old woman.
And the little pot cooked some porridge.
"Stop, little pot, stop," said the old woman.
And the little pot stopped cooking.
The little girl took the magic porridge pot to her mother.
"Cook, little pot, cook," said the little girl's mother.
And the little pot cooked some porridge.
Soon the kitchen was full of porridge.
And still the magic porridge pot went on cooking.
Soon the house was full of porridge.
And still the magic porridge pot went on cooking.
Soon the street was full of porridge.
And still the magic porridge pot went on cooking.
Soon the whole town was full of porridge.
And still the magic porridge pot went on cooking.
"Stop, little pot, stop!" said the little girl.
At last the magic porridge pot stopped cooking.
But the whole town is still eating porridge!
