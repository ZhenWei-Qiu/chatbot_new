Kevin loves chocolate very much.*
He only likes to eat chocolate but not other food.*
"Try this soup," says his mom.*
"No, Mom. That has carrot in it and it tastes yucky!" says Kevin.*
"Try this fish," says kevin's dad.*
"No, Dad. That tastes fishy and salty!" Kevin yells.*
"Try some cabbage," says his grandma.*
"No Grandma. That tastes like grass," says Kevin.*
"From now on, just give Kevin chocolate, and only chocolate!" says Kevin's grandpa.*
"Well... Why not?" said Kevin's mom and dad.*
On the first day, "Chocolate taste so great!"*
On the second day, "Oh, chocolate taste so good."*
But on the third day, Kevin says, "I want to eat an apple."*
He looks in the fridge.*
Everything in the fridge is chocolate.*
He looks in the cupboards.*
"Chocolate! Chocolate! CHOCOLATE!" Kevin screams.*
On the fifth day, "Mom, Dad! Please! No more CHOCOLATE!"*
"Are you sure?" ask Kevin's dad.*
"Yes! Yes! I'm sure. I am very VERY sure!" says Kevin loudly.*
"Chocolate tastes good. But taste isn't everything!" Everyone laughs.*
