In a beautiful town, there was a shop called Garden of Eden.*
The shop owner, Old Adam, worked very hard with Salt and Sugar in the kitchen.*
In Old Adam's shop, he only sold crackers and cookies.*
When old Adam made the dough he shouted, "It's time to work, my dear Salt," then Salt quickly jumped in and started to work.*
Soon they had the delicious crackers and they were ready to be sold!*
When Old Adam made another dough, he yelled, "It's time to work my dear Sugar," then Sugar quickly jumped in and started to work.*
Soon they had the yummy cookies and then were ready to be sold too!*
On a sunny morning, Annie walked into Old Adam shop.*
"Good morning, Adam!"*
"Good morning, Annie! What can I do for you?" Old Adam said.*
"I need two bags of cookies, please!" Annie requested politely.*
"Do you want some delicious crackers?" Old Adams smiled and asked.*
"Nope! My friends and I like cookies more than crackers," Annie replied and waved goodbye to Old Adam.*
Tony ran into Old Atom's shop and said, "I want some cookies, please!"*
Old Adam looked up and said, "Oh hi, Tony! No crackers today?"*
"No! I like cookies more than crackers," Tony said firmly.*
Everyone in Old Atom shop wanted to buy only cookies but not crackers.*
There were plenty of crackers left in Old Adam's shop.*
Later on in the evening, the doorbell suddenly rang.*
"Maria, what can I do for you?" Old Adam looked at Maria and asked.*
"Thank God the shop isn't closed yet. Do you have any cookies left, Adam?" Maria asked hurriedly.*
Old Adam smiled and said, "Sorry! They are all sold out."*
"Really! No cookies left?" Maria said surprisingly.*
Old Adam was a bit confused.*
"I don't understand why people don't like crackers?" Old Adam murmured, looking at the crackers left in the boxes.*
The next morning  Old Adam walked into the kitchen and yelled, "It's time to work my dear Sugar," then Sugar quickly jumped in and started to work.*
Old adam kept asking Sugar to do the work.*
And Salt felt left out.*
Finally, he began to lose his patience.*
From that day on, the shop only sold cookies, and no crackers.*
Those cookies were so popular and they were sold out every day.*
"Ehy am I so popular?" Sugar said with a big yawn.*
"I can't stand it anymore," Salt shouted angrily.*
Salt pushed Sugar down and they started to fight.*
A moment later, Sugar had cuts and bruises all over his body.*
Old Adam heard the noise and quickly ran in.*
"Oh my! Look what you've done," Old Adam said worriedly and quickly put Sugar on some ice cubes.*
But... Sugar's body had already turned red.*
To punish Salt's bad behavior, Old Adam asked him to work in the boiling water.*
From that night on. Sugar has played an important role in making sweet shaved ice.*
As for Salt, he has accidentally become an important role in making hot salted soup.*
Now in Old Adam's shop, he was not only selling cookies but also sweet shaved ice and hot salted soup.*
Do not think that someone else is more blessed than you are.*
Sometimes it's because you're blessed in different ways.*
