At Happy Farm, there was a rooster named Ryan.*
The farmer gave Ryan the Rooster a gold necklace.*
Ryan was happy and proud.*
He strutted around the farm to show everyone that he was the smartest and the most handsome rooster of them all.*
One day, Ryan couldn't find his necklace.*
Ryan was so worried and depressed.*
Max the mouse got an idea, so he told Ryan about the idea and what he should do.*
Ryan agreed and came to a haystack.*
He strung together strands of hay to make a necklace.*
"This necklace looks almost the same as that gold necklace you have lost," said Max the mouse.*
Ryan was happy and said, "I'll never have to worry about losing my necklace again."*
The next day, the farmer came to the farm and he saw the necklace around Ryan's neck.*
The farmer asked, "Ryan, where did you get that necklace?"*
Brian answered, "Why do you ask? This is the one you gave me!"*
The farmer just went away with a frown.*
The following morning, the farmer brought Ryan breakfast.*
As he looked at the loose necklace around Ryan's neck, he frowned and asked, "Where did you get that necklace?"*
Ryan still answered, "Why, it's the one you gave me!"*
The farmer shook his head and walked away.*
That evening, it was raining heavily.*
Ryan was deeply asleep and he didn't even notice that his straw necklace was totally soaked by the rainfall.*
Early the next morning the farmer came and asked Ryan again, "Where is your necklace?"*
Brian said haltingly, "Errr... I took it off last night and I forgot to put it back on this morning."*
The farmer didn't say a word and left with the small sack in his hand.*
That afternoon the sun finally came out.*
Ryan rushed hastily over to the haystack and quickly made himself another straw necklace.*
He thought to himself, "All I have to do is make another straw necklace and put it on, then no one will notice that my necklace has disappeared."*
From that day on, everyone noticed that every time after the rain, the farmer would come to the farm with that small sack in his hand and go looking for Ryan.*
However, the farmer would just walk away with a frown.*
After a long while. Ryan was so wrapped up in what he was doing that he often forgot to eat.*
Because of this, Ryan became thinner and his beautiful feathers all turned gray.*
One day, there was a great thunderstorm.*
The whole field of hay was flooded, and all the hay soaked up the rain.*
That night, Ryan was so worried and just paced nervously in the coop, murmuring to himself, "What should I do? What can I use now to make a necklace?"*
Then suddenly, the farmer appeared in Ryan's coop.*
Without saying a word, the farmer opened the small sack and took out a necklace.*
"That's my gold necklace!" shouted Ryan with the great surprise.*
The farmer said gently, "I found it on the grass and I wanted to give it back to you, but you never wanted to admit that you had lost the necklace."*
Brian cried loudly and said, "I'm so sorry! Will you please forgive me?"*
The farmer sighed and said, "Yes, I will; however, as a punishment, I'll give the necklace to Roy the Rooster."*
The next day, the gold necklace was on Roy the Rooster, and he was so happy and proud to have the gold necklace on his neck.*
Mistakes are always forgivable if one has the courage to admit them.*
