It was very windy and cold in the South Pole in May.*
The male emperor penguins huddle together to keep the eggs warm.*
A few months later, the chicks of the little penguins hatched one after another.*
There was a penguin family whose chick just hatched.*
The father named his baby penguin Dustin.*
"Oh... my darling baby Dustin!" Dustin's dad said happily and proudly.*
The whole family was so happy and pleased to have their new member, baby Dustin in the family.*
There was another penguin named Jack who was the family friend.*
He also had a baby penguin.*
Jack named him Troy.*
"I'm back," said Dustin's mom, who had just returned from the ocean with a fish in her beak.*
She was back to help take care of baby Dustin, who had just turned one month old.*
Baby Dustin was a very active penguin chick.*
He often ran here and there.*
"Don't run so fast!" said Dustin's mom as she waddled after him.*
One day, baby Dustin and baby Troy were playing on the ice together.*
Suddenly, a seal came and snatched baby Troy away.*
Baby Dustin was totally stunned by what he had just seen.*
After that, no matter how much his mom and dad comforted him, baby Dustin just kept asking, "Why would such a terrible thing happened?"*
The tragedy of losing baby Troy really hurt everyone.*
Baby Troy's dad, Jack, became so quiet for a long time.*
After some time, Jack started visiting and spending time with baby Dustin's family again.*
Baby Dustin really was a very kind and well-behaved little penguin.*
Looking at baby Dustin who was growing up little by little really helped heal Jack's broken heart.*
The next year in May, thousands of male penguins huddled together again.*
Jack had another new egg between his feet.*
This time, Dustin and his dad had also huddled together with Jack around the new egg.*
"Uncle Jack, I'll help you protect you and your new baby!" said Dustin bravely.*
Jack smiled and his heart was filled with happiness and content.*
The new baby, Jenny was a very sweet and gentle baby penguin chick.*
She filled Jack's heart with happiness again.*
Dustin often helped take care of baby Jenny.*
As time went by, Dustin grew up and became a mature male penguin.*
Despite the tragedy, Dustin saw how happy Uncle Jack was when he was with baby Jenny, he decided he no longer wanted to spend time worrying about the bad things that might happen to him.*
Instead, he wanted to be a great and brave male penguin just like Uncle Jack.*
Sometimes we cannot predict what will happen in our lives, but there are many things we can do to help the world become a better place.*
