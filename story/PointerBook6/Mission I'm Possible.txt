In a small pretty village near a big city, there was a tiny school called Rainbow Land.* 
Everybody in the school was busy packing and loading the school bus.*
Soon they would move to another new school that is located on the other side of the city.*
"Let's go and take a look at our new school!" the school principal, Mr. Nelson said.*
Everyone was on the school bus when Carlo the cat got on the bus.*
He walked towards Faith the Flamingo and squeezed into the same seat with her.*
Olivia the Owl yelled, "Mr. Nelson, Carlo isn't sitting at his seat!"* 
"I don't want to sit next to Eddy," Carlo said with a grumpy look.*
Mr. Nelson then spoke up, "Carlo, you should sit in your own seat. I have arranged the seats this way to keep the bus in good balance. Safety is number one!"*
"Yes mr. Nelson!" Carlo answered and walked to his seat.*
Mr. Nelson and the students were all ready to hit the road and began their journey.*
"Mr. Nelson, we are going to see rainbows at our new school, right?" Eddy the elephant asked and sounded very excited.*
"That's right! Whoever has the courage to face difficulties will be able to see the rainbow more easily," Mr. Nelson said with a big smile.*
They all buckled up and off to the new school they went.*s
On the way, everyone was having so much fun looking out the windows and enjoying the nice scenery outside.*
Gary the Giraffe shouted, "Wow! Look, there are many stores."*
"There are so many cars!"*
Gary pointed up to a sign in front of them and said, "Look up there!Tthe sign says DEAD END."*
All of a sudden, the ground started shaking.*
The bus was tossed off the bridge and into a creek.*
"Oh my, it's an earthquake!" Eddy the elephant shouted timidly.*
"Help! I'm so scared!" Kelly the koala cried loudly.*
"Mr. Nelson, what should we do?" Carlo the cat yelled.*
Luckily, nobody got hurt seriously.*
However, the biggest problem was...*
Mr. Nelson had been knocked out.*
Everyone started to panic and some even cried hopelessly.*
To make matters worse, the water began to rise, filling the bus.*
Carlos shouted, "The water is pouring into the bus!"*
Eddy bent down to him and said, "Don't be afraid! Come on, just climb onto my back!"*
Carol felt so embarrassed about being so mean and unfriendly to Eddy before.*
"It's really OK. Let's all work together and overcome this challenge!" Eddy replied with a smile.*
Everyone on the bus all tried their best to stay calm and help one another.*
"We need to go find some help," Olivia suggested, "But I hurt my wings."*
"Faith, now we can only rely on you," said Carlo, looking at Faith with confidence.*
"No! I can't do it!" Faith replied timidly.*
"You have to believe in yourself and be brave," Gary tried to comfort Faith.*
"Go Faith! Go, go, go!" Everyone cheered loudly for Faith.*
Faith the Flamingo spread out her wings and flew out the window.*
She was so happy that she actually did it.*
She turns to everyone and said, "I did it! Just wait for me. I'll go get help and be back soon!"*
Everyone cheered for Faith, seeing her flying higher and farther away.*
After a while, Gary pointed to the sky and shouted, "Look! It's a rainbow."*
"Yeah!" everyone shouted happily.*
After going through this unforgettable journey together, everyone not only completed an impossible mission, but they have all grown stronger and have become better friends than they were before.*
A friend in need is a friend indeed.*
