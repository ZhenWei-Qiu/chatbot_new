A king and queen had a baby girl.*
The good fairies came to see her.*
"How beautiful she is!" they said.*
The fairies cast spells for the baby princess.*
"She will be kind," said one fairy.*
"She will be clever," said another fairy.*
Then, a bad fairy came in.*
She looked at the baby princess.*
"How beautiful she is!" said the bad fairy.*
Then she cast a bad spell.*
"The princess will prick her finger and die!" she said.*
But then a good fairy cast a spell.*
"The princess will not die. She will prick her finger and fall asleep for one hundred years."*
Years went by and the princess grew more kind and more beautiful.*
One day, the princess found a spinning wheel and pricked her finger.*
She fell asleep.*
The king and queen fell asleep, and everybody in the castle fell asleep.*
Years went by and thorns grew on the castle.*
One hundred years went by.*
Then one day, a prince came to the castle.*
The prince cut down the thorns and went in the castle.*
He looked at the sleeping princess.*
"How beautiful she is!" he said.*
The prince gave the sleeping princess a kiss and she woke up.*
The king and queen woke up, and everybody in the castle woke up, too.*
"Will you marry me?" said the prince.*
"Yes," said the princess.*
So she did!
