Woody doesn't like to do things with other kids.*
He thinks no one likes him, so he just wants to be alone.* 
Today, Woody's class goes camping.*
At the camping site, everyone is busy putting up tents and preparing things for tonight's barbecue.*
Woody just sits on a log with his only friends, Nora.*
He doesn't want to help out the other kids.*
Actually, he is just afraid others will make fun of him.*
"Woody, can you pass me the tent stake please?" ask Simon.*
Woody pretends to not hear him.*
But Nora wants to help.*
"Hey, just let him be," says Woody with a frown.*
"I want to give him a hand," says Nora.*
"Well, you go ahead then. I don't want to work hard," says Woody, sounding very snobby.*
Nora goes to help out the others and leaves Woody sitting alone.*
"This is boring," says Woody, feeling lonely.*
"Everybody, come and try my sausages. They're super tasty!" shouts Nora excitedly.*
"Yuck. I don't want any. They smell like they're burned!" Woody thinks.*
Teacher Max notices Woody is alone and eating nothing.*
"Woody, we still need one more person for our campfire play tonight. Do you want to join us?" ask Teacher Max.*
"I... I don't...well...Ok...if I can do it...," says Woody.*
"Where should the bunny come out in the first scene?" ask Nora.*
"She could jump out from behind the tree," Woody suggests quietly.*
"What a great idea!" says Teacher Max.*
"Then, what about the big bad wolf?" ask Simon.*
Everyone starts to think.*
"Maybe he could come out from behind the house...," says Woody.*
"Yeah, that's wonderful!" says everyone.*
Suddenly, Woody understands that no one will make fun of him, but they are all nice and kind.*
He also thinks, "Hey, I'm actually pretty smart!"*
Now, Woody no longer hates doing things with others.*
In fact, he really enjoys it!*
Working together as a team is fun!*
