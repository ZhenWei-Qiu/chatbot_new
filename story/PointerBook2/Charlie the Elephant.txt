Charlie is a shine little elephant.*
When all the other little elephants are singing happily together, Charlie just sits quietly aside listening to them.*
Charlie sometimes sings his own songs when he is alone.*
Charlie loves to think.*
While all the other little elephants are trying to get the latest new toys, Charlie always sets his mind on some interesting ideas and ask questions.*
"Why is the sky blue?"*
"How does spring call out to the flowers to blossom?"*
"Where does the sun live?"*
Every afternoon, all the little elephants like to take a nap under the trees.*
But not charlie.*
He enjoys soaking in the river and taking us a sunbath.*
Charlie's friends always say, "Charlie is our good friend, but he is so different from us."*
Sometimes, Charlie worries and he asks is mommy.*
"Is there something wrong with me?"*
Charlie's mommy always says to him, "My dear, if you enjoy doing the things you are doing, they also make you happy. I think there is nothing wrong with you. Just relax and be yourself!"*
Charlie seems to understand what his mommy says, but somehow he is a bit confused.*
On this day, the teacher says, "Please draw a picture that shows something about yourself!"*
All the other little elephants start to draw their pictures, but Charlie just sits there and keeps on thinking.*
After a while, he decides to look at what other little elephants are drawing.*
There are an airplane, an orange, a flower an ice-cream cone, a butterfly and other things.*
"Maybe I should try to be like the others," Charlie thanks.*
But he remembers his mother's words, "My dear, just relax and be yourself!"*
Charlie takes the brush and starts painting.*
It is a very lovely and colorful picture.*
"Hey look! This is my picture!" Charlie says happily.*
He really liked the way he paints.*
What a creative little elephant Charlie is!*
Feel free to be creative.*
