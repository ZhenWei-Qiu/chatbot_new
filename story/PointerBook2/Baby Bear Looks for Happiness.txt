Baby Bear is looking for happiness.*
Baby Bear meets Little Bunny in the woods.*
"Is happiness around here?"*
"Yes, happiness is always here when I eat carrots."*
Baby Bear takes a bite of a carrot.*
"Happiness taste bitter."*
Baby Bear sees Little Lamb.*
"Do you know what happiness looks like?"*
"Sure, this lovely field of grass is my happiness."*
Baby Bear takes a bite of the grass.*
"Happiness tastes bad."*
Baby Bear looks up and sees Little Sparrow.*
"Do you see happiness up there?"*
"You will see it when you fly high," says Little Sparrow.*
Baby Bear climbs up a tree, waves his arms and jumps.*
"Ouch! Happiness is painful!"*
Baby Bear goes to a riverbank and asked Little Fish.*
"Can you find happiness down there?"*
"Yes, just jump in the river and swim like us, then you will find it."*
Baby Bear jumps into the river.*
"Goodness me! Happiness is so cold and it's dangerous!"*
Baby Bear runs home crying.*
"I can't find my happiness! Little Bunny gets it in carrots. Little Lamb has it in grass."*
"Little Sparrow flies with it in the sky. Little Fish swims with it down in the river. But where is my happiness?"*
Mommy Bear hugs Baby Bear tenderly.*
"My dear baby, you have me and I love you forever."*
Baby Bear smile and soon falls asleep happily in Mommy Bear's arms.*
