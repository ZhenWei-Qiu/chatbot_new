It's the time that all the little dandelions are ready to say farewell to Mother Dandelion and fly away.*
"One, two, three... fly!" Mother Dandelion watches her children happily.*
With Mrs. Wind's breeze, all the little dandelions fly toward where they dreamed.*
"Mommy, Mommy!" Mother Dandelion starts looking for where the voice is coming from.*
"Little Dandelion, why are you still here and not flying away with your brothers and sisters?"*
"I'm afraid to fly that high," Little Dandelion says, grasping his mom's hands tightly.*
"You can do it!" Mrs. Wind encourages him with her gentle breezes, but Little Dandelion just won't open his parachute.*
A sparrow that is standing on a flower petal asks, "Hey, kid, why are you still here? Have you just missed Mrs. Wind's breeze?".*
"No, I'm afraid to fly that high!" says Little Dandelion sadly.*
"Oh, you can do it! The field of grass looks so beautiful from the air!" says the sparrow.*
A dog with a dewdrop on his nose sniffs Little Dandelion says, "Little Dandelion, why are you still clinging to your mother so tightly? Aren't you going to ride on Mrs. Wind's breeze and fly high?"*
"I'm afraid to fly that high. I'll get hurt badly if I fall." Little Dandelion gets so scared and his eyes start to fill with tears.*
"Oh, you can do it! Go to this southern brook and see how fresh and sweet the water is!" says the dog.*
Mrs. Wind's spring winds are going to end soon and so are Little Dandelions chances of flying away.*
Mother Dandelion is very worried because she knows she is getting older and she can no longer take care of Little Dandelion.*
Little Dandelion doesn't want his mom to worry.*
He decides to give it a try.*
He starts thinking about the beautiful field of grass and the southern brook, so he tells himself, "I can do it!"*
Mrs. Wind comes again.*
Little Dandelion takes a deep breath and opens his parachute, "Hey, this isn't scary at all! It's actually so awesome!"*
"Goodbye my dear," Mother Dandelion watches as Little Dandelion flies higher and further with no fear.*
Once we overcome our fears, we become confident.*
