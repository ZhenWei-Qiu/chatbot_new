Cinderella lived with her stepmother and stepsisters.
Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters made Cinderella clean the house.
One day, there was a ball at the castle.
"Can I go to the ball?" said Cinderella.
"No," said her stepsisters. "You do not have a dress," said the first stepsister.
"You do not have any shoes," said the second stepsister.
A fairy godmother came to Cinderella's house.
She made Cinderella a beautiful dress and some beautiful shoes.
Cinderella put on her beautiful dress.
She put on her beautiful shoes.
"Now I can go to the ball," she said.
The prince danced with Cinderella.
After the ball, the prince found Cinderella's shoe.
"I will marry the girl who fit the shoe," he said.
The prince came to Cinderella's house.
"Is this your shoe?" he said.
"Yes, this is my shoe," said the first stepsister.
But the shoe did not fit.
"Is this your shoe?" said the prince.
"Yes, this is my shoe," said the second stepsister.
But the shoe did not fit.
"Is this your shoe?" said the prince.
"Yes," said Cinderella.
She put on the shoe and it fit.
"Will you marry me?" said the prince.
"Yes," said Cinderella. So she did!
