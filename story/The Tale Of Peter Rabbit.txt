This is Peter Rabbit.
Peter is with his mother and his three sisters.
Peter Rabbit・s mother said, "Don・t go into the farmer's garden."
Peter・s sisters went to get some berries for supper.
But bad little Peter Rabbit wanted to get some radishes.
He went into the farmer・s garden.
Peter ate and ate.
He ate all the radishes in the garden.
He ate so much that his tummy hurt.
Oh no! The farmer saw Peter Rabbit.
"Oh no!" said Peter Rabbit.
He ran away to hide.
The farmer ran after Peter.
But the farmer could not catch him.
Peter Rabbit ran into the shed to hide.
But then the farmer went into the shed, too.
The farmer saw Peter!
Peter Rabbit ran out of the shed.
Then the farmer ran out of the shed, too.
But he could not catch Peter Rabbit.
Peter Rabbit ran out of the garden.
Peter ran and ran.
He ran so much that his tummy hurt.
Bad little Peter Rabbit went home.
At home, Peter・s mother said, "Go to bed."
Peter Rabbit went to bed with no supper.
And Peter Rabbit・s three sisters ate all the berries for supper.
