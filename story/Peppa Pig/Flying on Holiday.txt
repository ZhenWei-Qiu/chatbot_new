Peppa and George are packing for a holiday.*
Daddy Pig asks them to take only the important things, so Peppa takes Teddy, and George takes Mr. Dinosaur.*
After they finish packing, Mr. Bull's taxi comes.*
He puts the bag on his taxi and drives Peppa and her family to the airport.*
They arrive at the airport.*
Aeroplanes are taking off and landing with passengers going away and coming home.*
Mr. Bull bids them farewell and says, "Have a nice trip!"*
It is a busy airport.*
They have to check in first.*
Miss Rabbit checks their tickets and asks them to put their bags on the scale.*
Then, they join the queue for security checks.*
Peppa and her family are about to get on the aeroplane.*
"Aeroplane!" cries George.*
George loves aeroplanes.*
So does Peppa.*
Miss Rabbit is the flight attendant.*
She welcomes everyone aboard.*
Both Peppa and George sit next to a window.*
The aeroplane takes off and flies higher and higher into the sky.*
Peppa and her family are on their way to a sunny holiday.*
