It's a lovely snowy day.*
Peppa and her family want to go to the top of the mountain to go skiing.*
The only way to get there is to take a ski lift.*
They hop on the ski lift, and slowly move up.*
"It is really fun to take a ski lift!" says Peppa.*
But Daddy Pig is a little bit scared of heights.*
At the top of the mountain, Peppa and her family get skis from Miss Rabbit's stand.*
There are skis for adults and skis for children.*
Madam Gazelle is the ski teacher.*
She is a world champion skier.*
She shows everyone how to ski, and it is impressive.*
Then, she asks, "Now! Which Mummy or Daddy would like a go?"*
Mummy Pig decides to give it a try, but she hasn't skied for years.*
She turns the wrong way and skis all the way down the mountain.*
Mummy Pig bumps into a house and stops.*
Madam Gazelle thinks that her skiing is excellent and gives her a trophy!*
Everyone laughs and congratulates her.*
