Peppa and George come to play in Grandpa Granny's garden.*
Grandpa has made something a little train!*
"This is Gertrude," says Grandpa Pig.*
"She is a miniature locomotive."*
Gertrude has car wheels, so she does have to go on tracks.*
Peppa and George hop on the train and go for a ride with Grandpa Pig.*
They meet Granddad Dog and Danny Dog.*
Granddad Dog laughs at Grandpa Pig's toy train, but Danny wants to ride on the train.*
So Granddad Dog allows him to go with Peppa and George.*
Then they meet Miss Rabbit and the school bus.*
All Peppas friends are there.*
They see the little train and ask Miss Rabbit to let them ride on it.*
So all the children are on Grandpa Pig's little train.*
When Miss Rabbit drives through a puddle of mud, her school bus gets stuck.*
Granddad Dog tries to pull the bus out with his breakdown truck, but the bus doesn't move.*
Then Grandpa Pigs little train comes to help.*
It pulls and pulls and finally pulls the bus out!*
"Hooray!" cheer the children on the train.*
"Gertrude is the very best train in the whole world!" says Peppa.*
