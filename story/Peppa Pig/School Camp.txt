Peppa and her friends are going on a school camp.*
"This is our camp site," says Madam Gazelle.*
Everyone gets off the bus, each carrying their own camping bag.*
They are excited to go camping!*
Now, it's time to put up a tent.*
It is not easy.*
There are pegs, ropes, poles....*
But the children learn quickly.*
Peppa and Suzy finish putting up their tent.*
"Now, you have to find a partner to share a tent with," says Madam Gazelle.*
Peppa asks Suzy to be her partner, but Suzy wants to be with Zoe, and Zoe wants to be with Rebecca...*
Finally, Suzy decides to be Peppa's partner.*
The children build a campfire together.*
Soon it's nighttime.*
Everyone sits around the campfire and asks Madam Gazelle to sing a camp song.*
They sing the "Bing Bong" song together.*
It's time to sleep in the tent.*
Suddenly, Suzy hears a strange noise.*
She doesn't know what it is.*
Both Peppa and Suzy are very scared.*
Suzy, Peppa, and all the children are very scared, so they go into Madam Gazelle's tent.*
They sing the "Bing Bong" song again, and they don't feel so scared anymore!*
