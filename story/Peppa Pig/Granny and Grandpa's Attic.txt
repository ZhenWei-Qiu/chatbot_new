Peppa and Gearge are playing at Granny and Grandpa Pig's house today.*
Granny Pig is in the attic.*
"Why is Granny Pig up there?" asks Peppa.*
"We are tidying the attic" says Grandpa Pig.*
Grandpa Pig takes Peppa and George up to the attic.*
It is full of many old things.*
"Maybe Peppa and George can help us throw some things out," says Grandpa Pig to Granny Pig.*
They find a box full of bottles.*
"We can throw away this box," says Granny Pig.*
"No," says Grandpa Pig, "those are my ships in bottles!"*
He suggests that they throw away a box full of hats instead.*
Granny Pig says, "No! Those are my favourite hats!"*
Then Peppa finds a case.*
She says, "Let's throw away this old case."*
"No!" shout Granny and Grandpa Pig.*
"It is a record player" says Granny Pig.*
There are also several records that they loved when they were young.*
Grandpa Pig picks a record and puts it on the record player.*
It is his favourite.*
Peppa and George love it, too.*
They all dance to it.*
Suddenly, Mummy Pig rings the doorbell.*
She is there to pick up Peppa and George.*
Mummy Pig finds a record.*
She used to play it all the time when she was a little piggy.*
She plays the record, and they all sing the song together.*
In the end, they can't decide what to throw away.*
Peppa suggests, "we should keep everything!"*
