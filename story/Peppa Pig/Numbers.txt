Today, Madame Gazelle is teaching the children about numbers.*
Pedro can count to four.*
Rebecca can count to seven!*
"And after seven comes eight, nine, and ten!" says Madame Gazelle.*
It's playtime.*
Peppa, Suzy, Zoe, and Rebecca are skipping.*
"Let's see who can skip the most without stopping," says Zoe.*
They start to skip while Rebecca counts.*
Zoe wins!*
Here comes Pedro with his hula hoop.*
Suzy wants to know how many times he can spin it without stopping.*
So Pedro hula hoops while the other children count.*
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!*
George wants to play leapfrog.*
"Leapfrog everybody!" says Peppa.*
They all get into position to play, and begin counting together.*
George leaps one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten times!*
Playtime is over.*
It's time to go back to the classroom.*
Madame Gazelle asks the children to skip together.*
Daddy Pig arrives early to collect Peppa and George.*
Madame Gazelle asks him to skip too!*
"Let's count to ten!" says Madame Gazelle.*
They skip ten times without stopping!*
Madame Gazelle says "To twenty!"*
They skip and count to twenty!*
Everyone has a great time counting!*
