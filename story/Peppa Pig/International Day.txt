Together, the whole class sing the Song of Harmony.*
It's playtime.*
All the children are playing nicely at the playground.*
They are playing on the slide, on the swings, on the roundabout, and in the sandpit.*
Zoe and Suzy want to play in the sandpit.*
But Pedro, George, Richard and Edmond were first.*
They don't want to leave.*
"You had your turn. Now it's our turn," says Suzy.*
The little ones start to cry!*
Peappa thinks Suzy is being unfair.*
The children start to argue with each other: Madame Gazelle overhears and comes to stop them.*
She says, "This is not how the countries of the world behave!"*
Madame Gazelle is right.*
They should treat each other nicely.*
When their parents arrive, the children decide to sing the "Song of Harmony" to them together.*
Peppa and her friends love singing together in harmony.*
All the countries in the World love singing together in harmony.*
