Peppa and her family are going on a drive to the mountains.*
It's a sunny day with a clear sky and few clouds.*
"We'll have a fantastic view when we get to the top of the mountain," says Daddy Pig.*
When the family arrives at the mountains, it starts to rain!*
"Oh, no! Get in the car. Quick!" says Daddy Pig.*
While everyone is kind of disappointed, Daddy Pig sees Miss Rabbit's ice cream stall.*
He gets out of the car and buys some ice cream for everyone.*
Daddy Pig buys four ice creams: orange for Mummy Pig, strawberry for Peppa, blueberry for George, and mint for himself.*
These are their favorite colors: red, blue, orange, and green.*
Then the sun comes out, and a rainbow comes out, too.*
"You can find treasure at the end of the rainbow!" says Mummy Pig.*
So they go to find the treasure.*
When they get to the next hill, the rainbow has moved to another hill.*
The rainbow is not easy to catch!*
However, it has been a great day chasing the rainbow!*
