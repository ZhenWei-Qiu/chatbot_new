It is Christmas Eve.*
Peppa and her friends go out to post their letters to Father Christmas.*
There are nine of them and each asks for a different present.*
"Peppa! George! Let's get our Christmas tree!" shouts Mummy Pig.*
They drive to the tree shop.*
Daddy Pig chooses a very big tree.*
It is so big that it can't be put on the car.*
So, Daddy Pig has to carry it home by himself.*
When Daddy Pig arrives home with the big tree, they start to decorate it.*
Peppa puts the glittery tinsel on, George hangs up the baubles, and Mummy Pig hangs up the fairy lights.*
To finish, Daddy Pig puts the star on the very top of the tree.*
Once Peppa and George are asleep, Father Christmas arrives on their rooftop.*
He checks the list to see what Peppa and George want.*
As he goes down the chimney, the list gets blown away.*
Peppa and George hear a noise and rush down stairs.*
They see Father Christmas!*
He gives them their presents and asks Peppa if she knows what her friends asked for as his list has blown away.*
She does and tells him what each one of her friends wants.*
It is morning.*
All of Peppa's friends are here.*
She sees that everyone got the present they wanted.*
She is very proud that she gave Father Christmas so much help.*
All the children are very happy.*
They are having a wonderful Christmas.*
