It is time to go to bed.*
Daddy Pig says "Tomorrow, we are going to the seaside!"*
Peppa and George are very excited.*
They are looking forward to swimming in the sea and building sandcastles.*
Now, it's morning.*
A lot of snow fell last night.*
"But we are still going to the seaside, aren't we?" asks Peppa.*
Just then, Miss Rabbit's coach arrives despite the heavy snow.*
So Peppa and her family get on the coach.*
All of Peppa's friends are going to the seaside, too.*
They sing a happy song together along the way.*
They are expecting to have a lovely day at the beach.*
They arrive at the seaside.*
They are a bit disappointed.*
The beach is covered in snow, and the sea looks very cold.*
No one wants to swim in the sea.*
But Mummy Pig wants to give it a try, so she jumps into the water.*
"Wow, it's so cold!" cries Mummy Pig, and she runs out of the water quickly.*
Peppa and the other children want to build sandcastles.*
Daddy Pig teaches them how to build "snow castles" instead.*
Everyone has a great time at the seaside despite the snow!*
