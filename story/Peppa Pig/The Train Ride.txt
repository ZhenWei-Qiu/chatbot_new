Today, Peppa and her friends are going on a train ride.*
Mr. Rabbit is the station master, and Miss Rabbit is the train driver.*
Madame Gazelle buys the tickets and they all get on the train.*
"Here are your activity sheets," says Madame Gazelle.*
The children have to spot three things during their train ride: a boat, a signal box, and a tunnel.*
They see the trees and clouds but they are not on the list.*
Then they see Grandad Dog in his boat.*
"Is Grandad Dog on the list?" asks Peppa.*
Zoe says, "No, but a boat is on the list! Hooray!"*
The train goes up and down a hill.*
It stops at a signal box.*
"A signal box! Thats on our list!" says Peppa.*
The children tick off the signal box on their sheets.*
Suddenly, it goes dark.*
"I know. We're in a tunnel!" says Suzy.*
The tunnel is the last thing on the activity sheet.*
All of the children cheer, "Hooray!"*
They arrive back at the station.*
Mr. Rabbit wants to see everyone's ticket, but Pedro can't find his.*
It turns out that the ticket is in his hat.*
Everyone laughs.*
They all liked riding the train today.*
