Today is the school fete.*
All the children and their families are here.*
Miss Rabbit is running a raffle.*
"Try your luck! The top prize is a ride in a hot air balloon!" says Miss Rabbit.*
Peppa loves the idea of taking a balloon ride.*
She goes to buy a ticket because she wants to win the first prize.*
She gets a red ticket.*
Miss Rabbit says, "A red ticket wins the balloon ride!"*
Daddy Pig, Mummy Pig, Peppa, George, Teddy and Mr. Dinosaur get into the hot air balloon.*
Miss Rabbit heats up the balloon and up they go in the air!*
Suddenly, Peppa drops Teddy!*
He falls into a tree.*
Miss Rabbit lowers the hot air balloon and Daddy Pig tries to rescue Teddy with an anchor.*
As Daddy Pig is rescuing Teddy, the hot air balloon gets stuck in the tree.*
Luckily, it's the tree in Granny and Grandpa Pig's garden.*
They ask Grandpa Pig to help them get down.*
"Don't worry. I've got a ladder!" says Grandpa Pig.*
"Hooray!" cheers everyone.*
They climb down the ladder one by one.*
Then, Granny Pig treats them to some tasty chocolate cake!*
