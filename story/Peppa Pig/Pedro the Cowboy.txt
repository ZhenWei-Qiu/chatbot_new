It is a lovely, sunny day.*
Pedro has a new play tent.*
He woke up early and is waiting for his friends to come and play with him at the cowboy camp.*
Now his friends are here.*
"Howdy, everyone! Welcome to my cowboy camp," says Pedro.*
Everyone is curious about Pedro's tent.*
They want to be cowboys, too.*
While the kids are playing, Mrs. Pony brings a plate of beans on toast.*
This is what a real cowboy eats.*
The kids also like the beans on toast!*
After eating, Peppa asks Pedro if he knows a cowboy song.*
"Yes, I made one up!" says Pedro.*
He picks up his guitar and starts singing.*
It is a funny song about a cowboy and baked beans.*
Now, the kids want to hear a cowboy story in the tent.*
"Make it scary," says Danny Dog.*
Pedro starts to tell a story.*
It's about the Wild West and wild animals looking for food at night.*
Everyone has a great time eating beans, singing songs, and listening to scary stories.*
Soon, it's nighttime.*
The kids' parents come to pick the kids up.*
What a fun day!*
