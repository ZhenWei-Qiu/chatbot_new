Peppa and her family are going on a picnic.*
The picnic spot is on the other side of the river.*
"How do we get over there?" asks Peppa.*
Daddy Pig says, "We can take a little boat."*
Daddy Pig rings the bell, and here comes Grampy Rabbit with his rowing boat.*
"Would you like to cross the river?" asks Grampy Rabbit.*
"Yes, please," says Peppa.*
After Mummy Pig, Peppa, and George get in the boat, there is not enough room for Daddy Pig.*
"Don't worry. I'll come straight back for you!" says Grampy Rabbit to Daddy Pig.*
Then, Grampy Rabbit rows the boat to take Mummy Pig, Peppa, and George across the river.*
They are singing a happy song together.*
The Wolf family has come.*
Daddy Pig invites them to join the picnic.*
So, Grampy Rabbit and Daddy Pig take turns taking them across the river.*
After Grampy Rabbit makes one last trip to take the picnic basket to the picnic spot, Mummy Pig invites him to have the picnic together.*
Then they start to eat.*
The food is very tasty.*
But they forgot someone.*
When they finish eating, Peppa suddenly remembers that they forgot Daddy.*
Grampy Rabbit takes Daddy Pig across the river.*
Luckily, everyone saved something for him, and even Mrs.*
Duck saved him a worm!*
