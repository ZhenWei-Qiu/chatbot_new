It is home time at Peppa's playgroup.*
Madame Gazelle tells the children that there won't be any playgroup next week.*
"Why?" asks Peppa.*
"Because I am going away," says Madame Gazelle.*
When Peppa comes home, she tells Mummy and Daddy that there is no more playgroup because Madame Gazelle is going away.*
Mummy Pig thinks that they should throw Madame Gazelle a leaving party.*
It is the day of Madame Gazelle's leaving party, and everyone has come to help, including all her old friends.*
Some decorate the classroom, and some help in the kitchen.*
In the playgroup kitchen, everyone is helping with the party food.*
Emily and Wendy are decorating the cupcakes, and Danny is carrying the plates.*
Pedro is outside keeping guard in case Madame Gazelle comes back before the party is ready.*
He sees her approaching and tries to stall her.*
Then Daddy Pig announces that they are ready!*
"You can go in now Madame Gazelle", says Pedro.*
"Surprise!" everyone cheers.*
Madame Gazelle is confused and asks "Why is there a party for me?"*
"You said there was no more playgroup," says Peppa.*
Madame Gazelle says "There is only no playgroup next week! I am only going away on holiday."*
Everyone laughs, and then they enjoy the party together.*
