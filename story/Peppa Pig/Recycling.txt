It is early in the morning.*
Peppa and George are finishing their breakfasts.*
"Let's clear up the breakfast things," says Mummy Pig.*
"Ok Mummy!" say Peppa and George.*
Before Peppa throws a bottle into the rubbish bin, Mummy Pig stops her.*
"All the things that can be used again should be put in the recycling bin", says Mummy Pig.*
George helps put the newspaper into the recycling bin.*
The recycling bins are full and need to go to the recycling centre.*
Mummy Pig takes the bottles, Peppa takes the tin cans, and George takes the newspapers.*
They arrive at Miss Rabbit's recycling centre.*
"What is Miss Rabbit doing?" asks Peppa.*
Daddy Pig says, "She is recycling all the rusty old cars."*
Peppa and her family are recycling.*
The bottles go into the green recycling bin, the tins go into the blue recycling bin, and the newspapers go into the red recycling bin.*
They are ready to go home.*
But where is their car?*
Miss Rabbit is recycling it!*
"Stop! That's our car!" shouts Peppa.*
Miss Rabbit says, "Sorry, I just love recycling!"*
Peppa and her family laugh.*
Miss Rabbit returns their car and they drive it home.*
