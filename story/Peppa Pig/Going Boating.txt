Peppa and her family are going to have a picnic.*
They drive to the mountains and finally arrive at the lake.*
Miss Rabbit has several boats for rent by the lake.*
Miss Rabbit has many of boats.*
She has canoes, sailing boats, and pedalos.*
Peppa and her family choose the pedalo because it looks the most relaxing.*
Emily and her family come boating, too.*
They like canoeing.*
Captain Dog and Danny Dog are here, too.*
They take a sailing boat because Captain Dog is a very experienced sailor.*
They sail, row, and pedal across the lake and all stop at the tiny island.*
They take out their picnic lunches and start eating, drinking and relaxing on their own boats.*
Miss Rabbit rings the bell and calls the three boats to come back.*
"Time is up!" says Miss Rabbit.*
Then, Mummy Pig suggests, "Let's see who can get back first!"*
Daddy Pig and Mummy Pig take turns pedaling the pedalo.*
The Elephant family rows the canoe.*
But Danny and his father win the race because they discovered an engine for when there isn't any wind.*
