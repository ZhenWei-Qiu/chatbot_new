Mummy Pig is feeding Goldie, but she is not eating.*
"Maybe she is not feeling very well," says Mummy Pig.*
So they decide to take Goldie to the vet to see Dr Hamster.*
Daddy Pig drove the car to work, so Peppa, George and Mummy Pig have to take the bus.*
They wait at the bus stop for it to arrive.*
At the next stop, Mr Bull gets on the bus.*
He has to go to the music shop to get his tuba mended.*
Then Madame Gazelle, Mrs Cat, Mrs Sheep, and Mr Zebra get on the bus.*
They need to go to the supermarket.*
The bus arrives at the supermarket.*
Mrs Sheep, Mrs Cat, Mr Zebra and Madame Gazelle get off.*
Then the bus takes Mr Bull to the music shop.*
After that, Miss Rabbit says, "Last stop, the vet!"*
Finally, Peppa, George, and Mummy Pig arrive at the vet.*
The vet looks at Goldie the fish.*
She asks them to feed her again and Goldie starts to eat!*
"Maybe Goldie was bored at home. The interesting journey has cheered her up!" says Dr Hamster.*
After the vet, they take the bus home.*
Mr Bull, Madame Gazelle, Mrs Cat, Mrs Sheep, and Mr Zebra are on the bus going home, too.*
They sing a happy song together with Mr Bull's mended tuba.*
The bus trip is so much fun, and Goldie seems to be very happy, too.*
