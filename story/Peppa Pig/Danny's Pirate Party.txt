Today is Danny Dog's birthday.*
He is having a fun party.*
Everyone came dressed as pirates.*
Everyone wants to play the pirate game, so Granddad Dog explains the plan.*
"Go to Grandpa Pig's hideout and get back the treasure, but don't get caught!" he says.*
Grandpa Pig is waiting for the children.*
He calls Granddad Dog to ask him why they aren't here yet.*
It turns out that some kids need to go to the toilet...*
Granddad Dog finally gets all the kids onboard.*
"Anchors away, full sail!" says Granddad Dog.*
Now they are sailing to find the golden treasure!*
The kids arrive at Grandpa Pig's orchard.*
Everyone is very good at hiding and each of them snatches a bag of coins!*
They are chocolate coins.*
At the end of the pirate game, everyone sings happy birthday to Danny.*
"This is the best pirate party ever!" says Danny.*
Everyone laughs and enjoys the cake.*
