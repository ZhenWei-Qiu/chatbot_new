Today everyone comes to Grampy Rabbit's dinosaur park.*
There are dinosaurs of all sizes and colors.*
Of course they are not real dinosaurs.*
They are only pretend ones.*
Grampy Rabbit says there is a really big dinosaur.*
All the kids want to see it.*
"The easiest way to find it is to follow its footprints," says Grampy Rabbit.*
They find the big dinosaur: it's a really big dinosaur slide!*
Everyone is excited.*
They climb up the dinosaur's back and go down the slide one by one.*
After going down the slide, the next adventure is to find an egg.*
"Leave it to me," says Freddy Fox.*
"Foxes are good at hunting for eggs."*
Everyone follows Freddy and finds a giant egg.*
Suddenly, the egg opens up.*
There is a big chocolate cake inside!*
This is not a pretend cake.*
This is a real cake.*
It is a birthday surprise for Freddy!*
After everyone finishes their cake, Grampy Rabbit asks them all to sing along and dance with him.
Everyone has a good time at Grampy Rabbit's dinosaur park.*
