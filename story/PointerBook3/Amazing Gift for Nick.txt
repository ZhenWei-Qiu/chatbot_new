Nick's mom and dad come home with a little baby boy.*
They say, "Nick, come and meet your baby brother now!"*
"That's not my brother. I don't want any brothers!" Nick says with disgust when he sees the baby.*
"Please take care of your baby brother. I know you'll be a good big brother," says Nick's mom.*
"No way!" yells Nick.*
Then the baby starts to cry.*
He cries very loudly.*
Nick frowns and says to the baby, "You are the noisiest thing in the world!"*
Nick wants to put the baby in a trash can and throw him away.*
In a box and send him away.*
In an envelope and mail him away.*
In a hot-air balloon and let him fly away.*
In a boat and let him sail away.*
The baby crawls to a toy robot.*
"Don't touch it. That's my robot!" shouts Nick.*
The baby points to a toy giraffe.*
"That's mine. Don't even think about it!" yells Nick.*
The baby crawls to a teddy bear.*
"Don't touch that. That's my bear!" Nick screams.*
Then the baby crawls to Nick and opens his arms for a hug.*
Nick looks at the baby with a frown.*
The baby looks back at Nick with a frown, too.*
Nick looks into the baby's eyes.*
The baby then looks back at Nick with a big smile.*
And the baby starts to giggle.*
Then something amazing happens.*
Nick starts to smile.*
Nick starts to dance.*
Nick starts to play with the baby.*
Then Nick picks up the baby.*
The baby gives Nick a big kiss.*
Nick smiles and says, "I'm a big brother. I have a baby brother now."*
It is so nice to take care of others.*
