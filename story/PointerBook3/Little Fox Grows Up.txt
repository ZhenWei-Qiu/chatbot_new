One spring day, Little Fox was born.*
Mama Fox loves Little Fox very much.*
Little Fox looks up at Mommy Fox and asks, "Mommy, what is spring?"*
"Let's go out and feel what spring is like," replies Mama Fox.*
"In spring, the day is as long as the night. Now, just close your eyes and feel it, my dear."*
Little Fox feels the warmth in the breeze.*
He sees the flowers blooming beautifully and hear the bird singing happily.*
Little Fox takes a deep breath and says, "I can feel and see spring."*
Little Fox grows a little bigger in spring.*
A few months later, Little Fox asks his mommy, "What is summer?"*
Mama Fox replies, "In summer, the day is longer than the night. Now, just close your eyes and feel it, my dear."*
Little Fox feels the hot, shining sun and the brightness of the sunshine.*
He sees many trees full of ripening fruits and hears the humming of the cicadas in the bushes.*
"Mommy, I can feel summer," says Little Fox.*
Little Fox grows a bit bigger and taller in summer.*
A few months later, Little Fox asks Mama Fox, "What is fall?"*
"My dear, let's go into the woods and you will see what fall is like," Mama Fox replies.*
"In fall, the day is as long as the night. Now just close your eyes and feel it," Mama Fox tells Little Fox gently.*
Little Fox feels the coolness in the wind.*
He sees the falling of the tree leaves and the hardworking ants.*
Little Fox says, "I can feel fall, Mommy."*
Little Fox grows even taller and stronger in fall.*
A few months later, Little Fox ask Mama Fox, "What is winter?"*
"Put on your scarf and let's find out what winter is," Mama Fox says.*
"In winter, the night is longer than the day. Now just close your eyes and feel it," Mama Fox tells Little Fox and holds his hands tightly.*
Little Fox feels the coldness from the falling snow in the sky.*
He sees the bears all sleeping in their caves.*
Little Fox says, "Mommy I can feel winter."*
Little Fox grows older in winter.*
On his first birthday, Little Fox asks Mama Fox, "Why am I growing up?"*
"Wait, mommy, let me feel...," Little Fox closes his eyes and says.*
"What do you feel, my dear?" ask Mama Fox.*
Little Fox answers gratefully, "I feel love. Mommy loves me and I love you too!"*
