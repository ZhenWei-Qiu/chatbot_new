Rodney the frog is a boastful frog.*
Rodney always croaks and says, "I'm the best, the very best!"*
"I'm the best swimmer," says Rodney proudly.*
"I'm the best singer."*
"I'm the best fly-catcher!"*
Rodney then jumps high and catches three.*
But Rodney doesn't have a best friend.*
Actually, he doesn't have any friends.*
"Will you be my best friend? Rodney ask Bobby.*
"Sorry, no!" says Bobby.*
"Will you be my best friend?" Rodney ask Susan.*
"Sorry, no!" says Susan.*
Rodney asks many other frogs.*
"Will you be my best friend, please?"*
"Sorry, no!" says everyone.*
"Please, please, pretty please!" says Rodney.*
But no one wants to be his best friend.*
"I'll give you many flies. They taste delicious! Now will anyone be my best friend?"*
"Sorry, no!" everyone replies firmly.*
"How can I find a best friend?" Rodney says sadly.*
"Stop boasting!" shouts everybody.*
"Stop boasting? But I have to be the best, so everyone will like me," says Rodney surprisingly.*
"No you don't," says Susan.*
"You don't have to be the best. Just be kind."*
So, Rodney stop boasting.*
And he starts to be kind to everybody.*
"Would you like some delicious flies?" Rodney ask Bobby.*
"Ok, thanks," says Bobby.*
"Do you want to play with me?" Rodney ask Susan.*
"Do I have to be your best friend?" Susan asks doubtfully.*
"No, you don't," Rodney replies.*
"Ok, let's go play!" says Susan happily.*
Now everybody wants to be Rodney's best friend because he is kind and sincere now.*
Being kind is the best.*
