Molly comes to visit Luke and Little Emma.*
Today is Little Emma's birthday.*
Luke opens the door but he looks worried, so Molly asks, "What's the matter?"*
"Little Emma caught a cold last night and she was sick and weak."*
"Fish is very good food for Little Emma. But she doesn't like to eat fish," answers Luke.*
"Look at those delicious fish dishes on the table!"*
"Little Emma refused to take even a single bite of them," says Luke.*
"Where is Little Emma now?" asks Molly.*
"She's in her bed," answers Luke.*
Molly comforts Luke and says, "Don't worry! I have a good idea."*
Molly goes to the kitchen and starts cooking.*
She makes dish after dish.*
The dining table is covered with different food.*
There is pumpkin cheesecake, smoked chicken salad, ham sandwiches and potato soup.*
Little Emma smells the yummy food and walks into the kitchen.*
"Look at these dishes, they are all for your birthday! Come and eat some, my dear!" says molly.*
"Thank you Molly. They smells so great!" says Little Emma weakly.*
"After the meal, I have a gift for you," says Molly.*
Little Emma eats a lot.*
Soon, she starts to feel better and stronger.*
"Can I have my birthday gift now, Molly?" ask Little Emma excitedly.*
Molly gives Little Emma a hug and says, "You have it already."*
"Being healthy is the best gift for you."*
"I know you don't like to eat fish, but fish is a very good and healthy food for you."*
"I mashed up some fish and put them into every dish I cooked today," Molly says with a smile.*
"I'm sorry," says Little Emma.*
"I will eat more fish from now on."*
"What a lovely little kitten you are!" say Molly and Luke, and they give Little Emma a big hug.*
Good food keeps us healthy even though it may not always taste yummy.*
