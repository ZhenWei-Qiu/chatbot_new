The five little monkeys were ready for bed. 
Mama said, "Good night."
"Good night, Mama," the little monkeys replied.
Mama said, "Remember. Go right to sleep. No noise!"
Then she went out.
Soon one little monkey said, "Shh! Mama is not here. Now we can jump. We can jump on the bed!"
The naughty monkeys jumped and laughed.
"Look at us jump, jump, JUMP!" said the little monkeys.
One monkey jumped too high and fell off the bed.
There was a crash.
"OW!" he cried.
Mama heard the noise.
"What was that noise?" she asked.
Then she saw one little monkey sitting on the floor crying, "Boo hoo ¡K Boo hoo!"
The poor monkey said, "I fell off the bed."
"Did you jump on the bed?" asked Mama.
The monkeys didn¡¦t know what to say.
Mama knew what happened.
"Tell the truth, little monkeys!" said Mama.
"Yes, we jumped on the bed," they said.
Mama was worried, so she called the doctor.
The doctor said, "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"
Then Mama said, "Little monkeys. Go to sleep now! Or no more bananas!"
So the monkeys went straight to sleep.
