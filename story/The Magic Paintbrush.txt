Sui-Ming and his parents lived near a forest.
Every morning, Sui-Ming got wood from the forest.
He sold it in his village.
One evening, Sui-Ming sat next to a river.
A white bird flew down, and Sui-Ming drew a picture of it.
"I do not want to sell wood. I want to draw!" thought Sui-Ming.
One morning, Sui-Ming walked past a school.
He saw students painting.
Sui-Ming ran into the class.
"Can I paint, too?" he asked.
The teacher saw Sui-Ming's old clothes.
"You have no money," he said.
"Now, go!"
That night, Sui-Ming could not sleep.
"I can not paint," he thought.
"I must work because we have no money."
Then, Sui-Ming saw an old man in his bedroom!
"I have something for you," the old man said, "but you must help people with it."
In the morning, Sui-Ming found a paintbrush.
He painted flowers and a butterfly.
Sui-Ming's mother came in, and the butterfly flew on her face!
The paintbrush was magic!
Then, Sui-Ming painted some bread for his family.
"We are not hungry now!" they said.
Sui-Ming painted food and animals for people in the village.
Soon, the emperor of China learned about Sui-Ming.
He sent for him.
"Paint me a crown!" he said.
"No, my paintbrush must help people," said Sui-Ming.
"A crown can not help people."
"Put him in prison!" shouted the emperor.
The emperor took the paintbrush.
The emperor painted lots of money with the paintbrush.
It changed into snakes!
"Help!" he shouted.
The emperor took Sui-Ming from prison.
"Paint a big sea for me!" he told Sui-Ming.
Sui-Ming painted water and beautiful fish.
"Now paint me a big ship," said the emperor.
Sui-Ming painted a big ship, and the emperor stood on it.
"There's no wind!" the emperor shouted.
Sui-Ming painted a very strong wind.
The ship went under the water, and the people never saw the bad emperor again.
Sui-Ming went home.
Every day, he painted beautiful things.
He was very happy.
