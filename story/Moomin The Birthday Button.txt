Moomin is very happy this morning.
"It's my birthday!" he says.
"Happy birthday, Moomin!" say Moominmamma and Moominpappa.
They give Moomin a gold button.
"What a beautiful button!" he says.
"Thank you!" he says.
"Hello, Snufkin!" says Moomin.
"Look! I have a gold button!" says Moomin.
"Sorry!" says Snufkin.
"I can't talk now." says Snufkin.
"Hello, Sniff!" Moomin says.
"Look I have a gold button!" says Moomin.
"Sorry!" Sniff says.
"I can't talk now." Sniff says.
Then, Moomin goes to the beach.
"Snorkmaiden! Little My! Look!" says Moomin.
"I have a beautiful gold button!" says Moomin.
"Sorry!" they say.
"We can't talk now." they say.
Moomin's friends do not see his new button.
They do not talk to him.
Moomin is very sad.
"It's my birthday, but my friends aren't happy for me," Moomin says.
"Don't worry!" Moominmamma says.
"Let's make your birthday cake!" Moominmamma says.
Moomin loves cake, but he is very sad.
Then, he hears his friends.
"Moomin! Come here!" they say.
Sniff has a box in his hands.
"This is for you," say Moomin's friends.
"The box is from me" says Snufkin.
"The shells are from me!" says Snorkmaiden.
"The pebbles are from me!" says Sniff.
"The seaweed is from me!" says Little My.
"It's a treasure chest for you!" they say.
Then, they eat cake and sing "Happy Birthday!"
"Thank you!" says Moomin.
He is very happy.
