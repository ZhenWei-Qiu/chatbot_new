"I am hungry," said Baby Bug.*
Mama Bug smiled and gave Baby Bug a leaf.*
"You eat like a monster," she said.*
Inchworm heard Mama Bug say monster, so he cried, "Monster! Inch for your lives!"*
Inchworm tried to hide, but his bottom stuck out.*
When Toad hopped by, he said, "Inchworm, is that you?"*
Inchworm said, "Shhh! I am hiding! A monster is coming!"*
"Oh no!" said Toad.*
"A horrible monster? Leap for your lives!"*
Toad tried to hide, too, but his head stuck out.*
A mouse ran by with a mouthful of seeds.*
She said, "Toad, what are you doing?"*
"I am hiding from a horrible monster!" said Toad.*
"Oh my!" said Mouse.*
"A hairy, horrible monster? Scamper for your lives!"*
Mouse tried to hide, too, but her tail stuck out.*
Rabbit tripped on Mouse's tail.*
"Oops! Mouse, what is wrong?" said Rabbit.*
Mouse said, "It is awful, Rabbit! A hairy, horrible monster is coming!"*
Rabbit said, "Oh my goodness! A huge, hairy, horrible monster? Hop for your lives!"*
Poor Rabbit tried to hide, but his ears stuck out.*
Fox said, "What is going on around here?"*
"Why is everyone hiding?"*
Rabbit said, "Fox, do not you know? A huge, hairy, horrible monster is coming!"*
"Help me!" yelped Fox.*
"A hungry, huge, hairy, horrible monster is coming!"*
And he dived in a hole.*
Baby Bug was chewing a leaf.*
She said, "Hey! Why is everyone hiding?"*
"A monster is coming!" said Fox and Rabbit and Mouse and Toad and Inchworm.*
"Fly for your life!"*
Baby Bug looked this way and that.*
She said, "I do not see a monster, but I am so hungry I could eat a monster!"*
Inchworm heard Baby Bug say eat a monster.*
He shouted, "Have you heard? Baby Bug ate the monster!"*
"Hooray for Baby Bug!" everyone cried.*
Baby Bug was glad she was a hero.*
But talk about eating always made her hungry.*
Mama Bug smiled and gave Baby Bug another leaf.
